🧵 I built a snake game where YOUR GitHub contributions are the food.

Here's what makes it different:

1/ Smart hunting - goes for darkest green first
2/ Self-recovery - shrinks when stuck, 100% completion
3/ Beautiful animations - smooth SMIL, no janky frames

Let me show you 👇

The snake isn't random - it PRIORITIZES.

Level 4 (darkest) → Level 3 → Level 2 → Level 1

This creates a dynamic, criss-crossing pattern instead of boring left-to-right.

More interesting to watch! 🎯

Your GitHub contributions → animated snake that eats them

✨ 6 beautiful themes
🎮 CLI + GitHub Action  
🏆 PvP battles coming soon

Built with Bun + TypeScript

#OpenSource #GitHub
```

### Follow-up

```
The cool part: the snake HUNTS by priority

Darkest green (most commits) first, then lighter ones

Creates this really dynamic pattern instead of just going left to right

Next up: multiplayer PvP battles against friends 🎮

🐍 Excited to announce Snake Evolution!

I've reimagined the classic Nokia snake game for GitHub:
Your contribution graph becomes a game where a snake devours your commits.

What makes it special:
• Smart pathfinding that prioritizes high-value contributions
• 6 stunning visual themes
• Works via CLI or GitHub Action
• 100% open source

Coming soon: PvP mode where you can challenge colleagues to snake battles! Imagine company leaderboards and team competitions. 🏆

```

Hey everyone! 

I just released Snake Evolution - an open source tool that turns your GitHub contribution graph into an animated snake game.

**What it does:**
- Generates an SVG animation of a snake eating your contributions
- The snake grows as it eats (like the classic game!)
- Smart pathfinding - hunts high-value contributions first
- Works via CLI or GitHub Action

**Why I built it:**
I loved Platane's original, but wanted more themes and smarter behavior. Plus, I'm building PvP mode where you can challenge friends!

**Coming in PvP:**
- Real-time multiplayer
- Each round gets faster + snake grows
- Power-ups (shrink, teleport, shield)
- Company vs company leaderboards

GitHub: https://github.com/miccy/snake-evolution

Would love feedback! Would you battle your coworkers in snake? 😄

Show HN: Snake Evolution – Turn GitHub contributions into an animated snake game

Hi HN!

I built an open source tool that generates snake animations from GitHub contribution graphs.

GitHub: https://github.com/miccy/snake-evolution

Features:
- Priority-based pathfinding (hunts darkest contributions first)
- Self-recovery (shrinks when stuck, guarantees 100% completion)
- 6 themes including a liquid glass iOS-style effect
- Works as CLI or GitHub Action

Tech: Bun, TypeScript, SMIL animations, Turborepo monorepo

Roadmap includes PvP multiplayer where users can challenge each other to snake battles with power-ups and leaderboards.

Happy to answer questions about the pathfinding algorithm or animation approach!
