This project ("Snake Evolution") was inspired by the original snake contribution
graph concept by Platane (Arthur Brongniart) - https://github.com/Platane/snk

However, Snake Evolution is NOT a fork. It is a complete independent rewrite
with the following key differences:

ORIGINAL CONCEPT (Platane/snk):
- Original snake eating contributions idea
- Basic pathfinding implementation
- Single rendering approach

SNAKE EVOLUTION (this project):
- Complete rewrite in TypeScript with modern stack (Bun, monorepo)
- Brand new pathfinding engine with priority-based hunting algorithm
- Entirely new SMIL-based renderer with advanced animations
- 7 custom themes (github-dark, github-light, ocean, sunset, neon-gamer,
  cypherpunk, glass) - all original design
- CLI tool with zero-install npm package support
- GitHub Action with extended customization options
- Modular architecture with separate engine, renderer, and theme packages

The only shared concept is "snake eats GitHub contributions". Everything else
(code, implementation, algorithms, themes, architecture) is original work.
